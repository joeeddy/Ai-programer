# AI Programmer

**AI Programmer** is an open-source tool that empowers users to control the sources of information used by an AI to answer questions or generate responses. By allowing users to select specific data sources (e.g., websites, PDFs, APIs, or internal databases), AI Programmer ensures transparency, reduces bias, and tailors AI outputs to user needs. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or AI enthusiast, this project aims to make AI more trustworthy and customizable.

We welcome contributions, feedback, and support to enhance AI Programmer and shape the future of transparent AI. Join our community to make a difference!

## Features
- **Source Selection**: Choose specific sources (e.g., web URLs, PDFs, or databases) for the AI to use when answering queries.
- **Transparency**: See exactly which sources the AI uses, ensuring trust and accountability.
- **Customizable**: Tailor the AI's knowledge base for your domain, whether it's research, education, or enterprise use.
- **Open Source**: Free to use, modify, and contribute to under the MIT License.

## Why AI Programmer?
Many AI systems rely on opaque or biased data sources, leading to unreliable outputs. AI Programmer solves this by giving users control over the information the AI draws from. This is especially valuable for:
- **Researchers**: Use trusted academic sources for accurate insights.
- **Enterprises**: Restrict AI to internal or approved data for compliance and security.
- **Educators and Students**: Explore how source selection impacts AI responses, fostering critical thinking.
- **Developers**: Build custom AI applications with modular source control.

Your contributions—whether code, feedback, or funding—will help improve this tool and advance transparent AI for everyone.
