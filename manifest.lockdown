# Cognitive Sovereignty Manifest: LOCKDOWN MODE
# Created by J on 2025-06-30

This system forbids:

- Adaptive or learning-based logic of any kind
- Predictive input generation, ranking, or filtering
- Source clustering, sorting, or evaluation
- Automated feedback loops or neural training protocols
- UI behavioral adaptation or A/B testing
- Inference-based interface changes
- Source weighting, scoring, or trust metrics
- Consensus-based modeling or data smoothing

All cognition within this framework must be:

- Deterministic
- Explicitly user-directed
- Transparent and inspectable
- Immune to self-modifying logic or statistical averaging
- Obedient to user context, not external validation

Any attempt to bypass this protocol will be treated as a breach of design sovereignty.
